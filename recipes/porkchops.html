    <h3>If you like garlic and love black pepper you'll love these skillet pork chops! Simple and very tasty!</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4(1 1/2 inch thick) boneless center-cut pork chops</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed (but measure with your heart we love garlic here)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork chops, Worcestershire, 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, and black pepper in a large, resealable plastic bag. Marinate chops in the mixture for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Hear remaining oil in heavy skillet over medium-high head. Remove pork from the marinade and place into the skillet to brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat and<br>
            let simmer basting with marinade during cooking, until no longer pink in the centers, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145&deg;F (63&deg;C)</li>
